# Introduction

Hello, I'm Andrew Wang, a Python programmer enthusiast who is currently learning Rust and likes Codeforces.

# Programming

I enjoy programming and have experience with Python, C++, Java, and Rust. I find Rust to be particularly interesting because of its focus on safety and performance. I am also an active member on Codeforces, a competitive programming website, where I enjoy solving challenging problems.
